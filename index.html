            <h2>Originate of Yoga</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Yoga is originated 5000 years ago in India by Indian monks. The posture of yoga were created for a
                specific health purpose. Each posture was designed to detoxify, realign musculature, Strengthen muscle
                and create flexibility.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the practice of Yoga, we seek to create union between the mind and body. Yoga is the perfect example
                of holistic health because of this combination of mind and body. The body cannot exist without the mind
                vice versa. By repairing the body, we can repair the mind and keep the mind healthier. For Example, if
                you feel tense in the neck, shoulders or hip, you will find it more difficult to relax and be happy.
            </p>
            <br>

                Benefit of Yoga has well realised and wide spread across the world. Many people has become yoga
                instructors and teaching Yoga to others, a growing industry for the last 10 Years.

                Lots of classes to suit each individual person's need. The trainers are very friendly & patient,
                and the lessons are conducted in the slower pace, so it is easier to follow.
