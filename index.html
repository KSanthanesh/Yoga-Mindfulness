            In the practice of Yoga, we seek to create union between the mind and body. Yoga is the perfect example of holistic health because of this combination of mind and body.  The body cannot exist without the mind vice versa.  By repairing the body, we can repair the mind and keep the mind healthier.  For Example, if you feel tense in the neck, shoulders or hip, you will find it more difficult to relax and be happy.
