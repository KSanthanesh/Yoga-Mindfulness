            <h2>Originate of Yoga</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
               Yoga is originated 5000 years ago in India by Indian monks. The posture of yoga were created for a specific health purpose. Each posture was designed to detoxify, realign musculature, Strengthen muscle and create flexibility.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the practice of Yoga, we seek to create union between the mind and body. Yoga is the perfect example of holistic health because of this combination of mind and body.  The body cannot exist without the mind vice versa.  By repairing the body, we can repair the mind and keep the mind healthier.  For Example, if you feel tense in the neck, shoulders or hip, you will find it more difficult to relax and be happy.
            </p>

                Lots of classes to suit each individual person's need.  The trainers are very friendly and patient during the session and the lessons are conducted in the slower pace, such that it is easier to follow.
